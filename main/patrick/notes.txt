TODO:
	-improve rendering speed.
	-decouple updating from rendering, though at this point any decent system will run at the desired speed, with older systems
		running a tad bit slower. (not gamebreaking though)
	-improve variety of blocks.
	-customize the main characters animations, as well as appearence.
	-add enemies, with basic movement/attack mechanisms. //in progress.
	-add projectiles
	-add npc's with dialoque.
	-add inventory
	-add quests/missions.
	-dramatically expand map, add themes to the different sectors.
		NOTE: improve rendering speed and performance first.
	*-* clean up player.js code, (optimize/clean up reptitive bits)
